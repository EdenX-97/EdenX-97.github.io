## Scalability

- The system can scale up to support increasing demand and work

### Horizontal Scaling

- Add more machines

### Vertical Scaling

- Add more power (like CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to exist machine
- Cons: usualle need to have some downtime

## Availability

- The system is available at any time
- Sometimes a system can be available but not reliable (like a system running 10 years but store users' passwords in plaintext)

## Reliable

- The system can continue to provide services even when some components fail
- Need to const to resolving single point of failure
