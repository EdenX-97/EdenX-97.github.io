## 1. Introduction

Building a personal knowledge base and blog can be a great way to share your knowledge, thoughts, and experiences with others. With the right tools, it's easy to create a professional-looking website for your knowledge base and blog and make it accessible to others.

One option for building a knowledge base and blog is to use VuePress, a static site generator based on Vue.js. VuePress allows you to quickly create high-quality documentation websites with a minimal amount of effort. And with the Vuepress-theme-hope plugin, you can add a professional and attractive theme to your VuePress site.

Once you have VuePress and Vuepress-theme-hope installed, you can create your knowledge base and blog website by adding documents, articles, links, and other content to your VuePress project. You can use VuePress to create a separate section for your blog, where you can add your blog posts and organize them by category or tag. Then, you can use VuePress to generate a static website that can be shared with others.

To make your knowledge base and blog website even more accessible, you can use GitHub Pages to host it. GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that makes it easy to create and host static websites on GitHub. With GitHub Pages, you can host your knowledge base and blog website on GitHub and make it available to anyone with an internet connection.

Now, let's use VuePress, Vuepress-theme-hope, and GitHub Pages to quickly build a personal knowledge base and blog website and share your knowledge, thoughts, and experiences with the world.

In `/src/.vuepress/config.ts`, modify the `title` and `description` for your knowledge base website, for example:

```typescript
locales: {
  "/": {
    lang: "en-US",
      title: "Eden's Knowledge Base",
        description: "Eden's knowledge base and blog",

### Configure Topbar and Sidebar

The file of topbar configuration is `/src/.vuepress/navbar/en.ts`, for example:

## 4. Hosting the Website on Github Pages

Github Actions is a powerful tool that allows users to automate various aspects of their workflows, including the deployment of projects to Github Pages. In this part, we will use Github Actions to set up an automated process for deploying this project to Github Pages. Then we can access the website through a public url.

### Create Github Pages Repository

Go to your Github Account, create a repository named `<your_username>.github.io`, for example:

![image-20221208011944004](/assets/notes/images/image-20221208011944004.png)

Then, in terminal, go to your project root folder, enter following commands:

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_username>.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

::: note Note

You need to set correct `hostname` in `/src/.vuepress/theme.ts` like `EdenX-97.github.io` which is same to your Github Pages link, then you can use this url to access your project.

:::

Final step, go to your repository, in `Settings-Pages` tab, change the Branch to `gh-pages`.

![image-20221208014857098](/assets/notes/images/image-20221208014857098.png)

After all actions completed, you can access your website through `<your_username>.github.io`, enjoy!
